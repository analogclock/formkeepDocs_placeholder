Form Designer allows you to make custom forms. Simply drag and drop question types into the lefthand area. Check out [this article](https://github.com/furiouscollective/formkeep-docs/blob/ghoffmann-features/_docs/2021-10-05-feature-form-designer.md) for instructions on using the tool.

# How to find the Form Designer
1. Click on any template form on the [form templates](https://formkeep.com/template_forms) page. Not sure where to start? Start with our [default contact form](https://formkeep.com/template_forms/contact-us-form?click=1).
2. Once a template is selected, you should see a brief description of the form and then a preview of the form, and a large red "Try for Free" button. Click the "Try for Free" button.

You should now be at the Form Designer tool! <br>
